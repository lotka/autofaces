\chapter{DISFA Neural Network}
\section{Data preparation}
The DISFA dataset is essentially a set of ordered images where each image has a
label which quantifies how how much of each AU is present.
\section{Multilayer perceptron}
As an introduction to the types of results that will be used to evaluate various
models this section shows the performance of a multilayer perceptron with one
hidden layer.

\caption{The losses a neural network consisting of an input layer, a 14
neuron hidden layer a branch of the same size as the input layer for autoencoding
and branches for binary softmax classifiers for each AU. The classifier mean squared
loss is shown only for interested, the network trains with the cross entropy.
The $\alpha$ coeffcicent determines the balance between the classifier and the
autoencoder losses.}
