  Limitations of a network which has no concept of time.

  Maybe CNN isn't the right tool for the job here
  Should have just used a slightly deep fully connected network
  with loads of dropout, noise and shit.

  Maybe doing the preprocessing before the reszie is better than what I'm doing,
  and should max pool instead of resize.

  Databalancing and cropping techniques would have helped.

  Joint versus stacked training of the autoencoder.

  I really wish I had taken exisiting good networks and adapted them instead of doing
  everything from scartch.

  Is there enough variance in the data?

  Could including other datasets help? Fusing datasources etc.
