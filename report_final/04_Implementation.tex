  \section{Deep Learning Framework}
    Tensorflow \cite{tensorflow} was chosen as the deep learning framework for this
    project. Many others exist, some advantages that tensorflow has over its rivals
    includes platform independence, distributed computing and inbuilt visualisation
    of network topology and parameters over time. As most other frameworks it uses python
    to define it's computations and also includes a C++ interface.
