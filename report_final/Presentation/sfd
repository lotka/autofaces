FAU detection is a problem which
has motivated a lot of machine leanring research.

Deep learning is also big at the moment.

There have been works where these are combined.

FAU poses unique challenges:

1. The variation between images is lower than in datasets typically used to train deep
neural networks because AUs can be signified by subtle changes.
2. They contain fewer images, for example compared to ImageNet[9] which has 3.2 mil-
lion labelled images.
3. AUs can occur simultaneously
4. Non-uniform AU occurrence frequencies as many frames in a video may contain no
AU occurrences (neutral faces) and some AUs may occur a lot less or a lot more than
others.

4. Change data blaancing
3. Binary softmax stuff
2.

This presentation describes the work I did for my masters thesis,
it is structured in the following way. First I will describe some of the background
related to FAU detection, the problems it poses and how they can be addressed
with deep learning or neural networks. Then I will talk about some of the models
we proposed to address these problems, introducing some deep learning background along the way.

Then  some indepth results on how these structures performed for classification.
