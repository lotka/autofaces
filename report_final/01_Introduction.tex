\chapter{Introduction} \label{chap:intro}
%   talk about self-reported pain and intensity estimation
%   why didn't I do any intensity estimation stuff?
%   Regression is difficult??? Classification is a different thing.
%   take about the fact that you are doing one frame and a time and
%   other methods might be better because they can do sequences.

  The human face is most likely one of the most researched objects in image analysis
  and computer vision \cite{S.ZafeiriouA.PapaioannouI.KotsiaM.A.Nicolaou}.
  It has wide ranging applications from Human
  Computer Interaction (expression recognition) to law enforcement (face recognition).
  Its study necessitates the development of a wide range of machine
  learning and computer vision research.

  Facial Action Unit detection FAU \cite{Corneanu2016} is chosen in this work due
  to it's popularity and available benchmarks.
  The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) developed by Ekman and Friesen,
  provides a systematic way to study any kind of facial expression,
  by representing them as a combination of individual facial muscle actions
  known as Action Units (AU). Automating the process of detecting AUs is difficult
  because they have non-linear interactions and often occur in very low intensities. % TODO: Reference?

  There exist many datasets containing images and videos of faces and it is a general
  observation that unlabelled images are far more abundant than labelled ones.
  In particular in the areas of expression recognition where painstaking work
  must be carried out to obtain the ground truth expressions for an image or set of
  frames in a video. This situation is one of the motivations for this project.

   represents many layers of neurons and the thin lines represent connections between layers.
   This diagram serves as a very high level description of the structure this project will
   investigate, the boxes in the hidden layers, called neural network structures may contain
   a variety of components including convolutional layers, fully connected layers, dropout layers
   and so on.}

  Deep learning is emerging as a powerful tool in modelling a wide range of patterns
  in data, it has been applied to the problem of FAU a number of times and achieved
  good classification rates. The unlabelled (neutral expressions) frames typical
  in such datasets make it more difficult for the supervised
  Deep Neural Network (DNN) techniques to make full use of the available information.

  This project uses the DISFA dataset, which is an example of a sparsely labelled dataset
  \footnote{Relative to datasets typically used for
            Deep Learning tasks, for example MNIST\cite{mnist}
            which has 70,000 labelled examples, which all fall
            into one strictly defined category.} and constructs neural network structure which
  can perform joint classificatio of AUs while also acting as an autoencoder.
  The use of the autoencoder is designed to exploit the information in the neutral faces
  and also focus in on features which might not be learnt via classifier only training.

  Further it examines whether
  smoothly transferring between autoencoder training and classifier training can improve
  the ability of the autoencoder to improve classification performance. The project works in a constrainted setting as
  even low intensity AU occurrences are counted as positive occurrences and the training set
  is not artificially expanded.

  \section{Potential Applications}
    The ability for a computer vision system to accurately classify actions in a
    human face could have a multitude of application. Human computer interfaces (HCI)
    could benefit from a higher bandwidth interactions between a computer and human, adding
    an extra channel to the typical keyboard and mouse. The medical profession would benefit
    as the ability to quantify psycological symptoms using facial expressions might lead to
    quicker diagnoses of illness and more personalised care.

  \section{Contributions}
    This work contributes a detailed exploration of how autoencoders and classifiers
    interact in a variety of settings. No substantial performance improvement is noted
    but interesting dynamics are observed. The method of per subject mean and standard
    deviation face normalisaion is put forward as the best way to preprocess images in DISFA
    for FAU detection.

  \section{Thesis Outline}
    The background relating to FAU detection and existing deep learning approaches
    are detailed in Chapter 2.

    The theoretical ideas needed to construct a deep learning algorithm are in
    Chapter 3, including methods for evalutation.

    Chapter 4 talks about the software implementation that was produced in this project.

    Chapter 5 shows how the DISFA dataset was processed and prepared.
