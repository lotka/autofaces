\begin{abstract}
  Deep neural networks typically require large amounts of labelled data to make useful
  predictions, however in most domains this data is rare and mainly unlabelled.
  This project aims to incorporate that unlabelled data into a deep learning algorithm.
  A network with an autoencoder and classifier is proposed to be able to simultaneously
  learn from labelled and unlabelled data in a semi-supervised way. Detecting
  facial actions units is the chosen domain to benchmark this approach, with
  the DISFA dataset being used for preliminary experiments.
