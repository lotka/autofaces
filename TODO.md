# TODO:
* Big plan for thursday
    * Create mangled MNIST data set
    * Figure out if using it improves the classification
        * Experiment 1: Control : No autoencoder, no unlabeled data
        * Experiment 2: Test    : Autoencoder with unlabled and labeled data
        * Just autoencoder?????????/
* Literature review
* Data reporting system. I think pickle will be good so that I can re print the data nicely.
# Complete
* Ask seb about autoencoder/classifier competition
