Maybe CNN isn't the right tool for the job here
Should have just used a slightly deep fully connected network
with loads of dropout, noise and shit.

Maybe doing the preprocessing before the reszie is better than what I'm doing,
and maybe the resize should be a max pool.

Databalancing and cropping techniques

Joint versus stacked training of the autoencoder.
