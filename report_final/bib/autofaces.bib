abstract = {Deep learning methods have resulted in significant performance improvements in several application domains and as such several software frameworks have been developed to facilitate their implementation. This paper presents a comparative study of five deep learning frameworks, namely Caffe, Neon, TensorFlow, Theano, and Torch, on three aspects: extensibility, hardware utilization, and speed. The study is performed on several types of deep learning architectures and we evaluate the performance of the above frameworks when employed on a single machine for both (multi-threaded) CPU and GPU (Nvidia Titan X) settings. The speed performance metrics used here include the gradient computation time, which is important during the training phase of deep networks, and the forward time, which is important from the deployment perspective of trained networks. For convolutional networks, we also report how each of these frameworks support various convolutional algorithms and their corresponding performance. From our experiments, we observe that Theano and Torch are the most easily extensible frameworks. We observe that Torch is best suited for any deep architecture on CPU, followed by Theano. It also achieves the best performance on the GPU for large convolutional and fully connected networks, followed closely by Neon. Theano achieves the best performance on GPU for training and deployment of LSTM networks. Caffe is the easiest for evaluating the performance of standard deep architectures. Finally, TensorFlow is a very flexible framework, similar to Theano, but its performance is currently not competitive compared to the other studied frameworks.},

abstract = {We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSRVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5{\%} and 17.0{\%} which is considerably better than the previous state of the art. The neural network, which has 60 million paramters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolutional operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers, we employed a recently-developed method called 'dropout' that proved to be effective. We also entered a variant of the model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achievd a top-5 test error rate of 15.3{\%}, compared to 26.2{\%} achieved by the second-best entry.},

Recent progress in this area has been due to two factors: (i) end to end learning for the task using a convolutional neural network (CNN), and (ii) the availability of very large scale training datasets. We make two contributions: first, we show how a very large scale dataset (2.6M im- ages, over 2.6K people) can be assembled by a combination of automation and human in the loop, and discuss the trade off between data purity and time; second, we traverse through the complexities of deep network training and face recognition to present meth- ods and procedures to achieve comparable state of the art results on the standard LFW and YTF face benchmarks.},

abstract = {Recent studies indicate that bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) recurrent neural networks are well-suited for automatic emotion recognition systems and may lead to better results than systems applying other widely used classifiers such as Support Vector Machines or feedforward Neural Networks. The good performance of BLSTM emotion recognition systems could be attributed to their ability to model and exploit contextual information self-learned via recurrently connected memory blocks which allows them to incorporate information about how emotion evolves over time. However, the actual amount of bidirectional context that a BLSTM classifier takes into account when classifying an observation has not been investigated so far. This paper presents a methodology to systematically investigate the number of past and future utterance-level observations that are considered to generate an emotion prediction for a given utterance, and to examine to what extent this temporal bidirectional context contributes to the overall BLSTM performance. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Despite efforts towards evaluation standards in facial expression analysis (e.g. FERA 2011), there is a need for up-to-date standardised evaluation procedures, focusing in particular on current challenges in the field. One of the challenges that is actively being addressed is the automatic estimation of expression intensities. To continue to provide a standardisation platform and to help the field progress beyond its current limitations, the FG 2015 Facial Expression Recognition and Analysis challenge (FERA 2015) will challenge participants to estimate FACS Action Unit (AU) intensity as well as AU occurrence on a common benchmark dataset with reliable manual annotations. Evaluation will be done using a clear and well-defined protocol. In this paper we present the second such challenge in automatic recognition of facial expressions, to be held in conjunction with the 11 IEEE conference on Face and Gesture Recognition, May 2015, in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Three sub-challenges are defined: the detection of AU occurrence, the estimation of AU intensity for pre-segmented data, and fully automatic AU intensity estimation. In this work we outline the evaluation protocol, the data used, and the results of a baseline method for the three sub-challenges.},

It depends on multiple factors including shape, appearance and dynamics of the facial features, all of which are adversely affected by environmental noise and low intensity signals typical of such conditions. In this work, we present a novel approach to Facial Action Unit detection using a combination of Convolutional and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks (CNN-BLSTM), which jointly learns shape, appearance and dynamics in a deep learning manner. In addition, we introduce a novel way to encode shape features using binary image masks computed from the locations of facial landmarks. We show that the combination of dynamic CNN features and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory excels at modelling the temporal information. We thoroughly evaluate the contributions of each component in our system and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the FERA-2015 Challenge dataset.},

abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

In this work, not only do we show that CNNs can achieve strong performance, but we also introduce an approach to decipher which portions of the face influence the CNN's predictions. First, we train a zero-bias CNN on facial expression data and achieve, to our knowledge, state-of-the-art performance on two expression recognition benchmarks: the extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) dataset and the Toronto Face Dataset (TFD). We then qualitatively analyze the network by visualizing the spatial patterns that maximally excite different neurons in the convolutional layers and show how they resemble Facial Action Units (FAUs). Finally, we use the FAU labels provided in the CK+ dataset to verify that the FAUs observed in our filter visualizations indeed align with the subject's facial movements.},

The efforts towards achieving a common platform for AU evaluation have been addressed in the FG 2015 Facial Expression Recognition and Analysis challenge (FERA 2015). Participants are invited to estimate AU occurrence and intensity on a common benchmark dataset. Conventional approaches towards achieving automated methods are to train multiclass classifiers or to use regression models. In this paper, we propose a novel application of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize AUs as part of FERA 2015 challenge. The 7 layer network is composed of 3 convolutional layers and a max-pooling layer. The final fully connected layers provide the classification output. For the selected tasks of the challenge, we have trained two different networks for the two different datasets, where one focuses on the AU occurrences and the other on both occurrences and intensities of the AUs. The occurrence and intensity of AU activation are estimated using specific neuron activations of the output layer. This way, we are able to create a single network architecture that could simultaneously be trained to produce binary and continuous classification output.},

We then recorded user interactions with the developed system, Automatic SAL, comparing the most communicatively competent version to versions with reduced nonverbal skills. High quality recording was provided by 5 high-resolution, high framerate cameras, and 4 microphones, recorded synchronously. Recordings total 150 participants, for a total of 959 conversations with individual SAL characters, lasting approximately 5 minutes each. Solid SAL recordings are transcribed and extensively annotated: 6-8 raters per clip traced five affective dimensions and 27 associated categories. Other scenarios are labelled on the same pattern, but less fully. Additional information includes FACS annotation on selected extracts, identification of laughs, nods and shakes, and measures of user engagement with the automatic system. The material is available through a web-accessible database.},

abstract = {Most modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for object recognition are built using the same principles: Alternating convolution and max-pooling layers followed by a small number of fully connected layers. We re-evaluate the state of the art for object recognition from small images with convolutional networks, questioning the necessity of different components in the pipeline. We find that max-pooling can simply be replaced by a convolutional layer with increased stride without loss in accuracy on several image recognition benchmarks. Following this finding -- and building on other recent work for finding simple network structures -- we propose a new architecture that consists solely of convolutional layers and yields competitive or state of the art performance on several object recognition datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet). To analyze the network we introduce a new variant of the "deconvolution approach" for visualizing features learned by CNNs, which can be applied to a broader range of network structures than existing approaches.},

abstract = {Access to well-labeled recordings of facial expression is critical to progress in automated facial expression recognition. With few exceptions, publicly available databases are limited to posed facial behavior that can differ markedly in conformation, intensity, and timing from what occurs spontaneously. To meet the need for publicly available corpora of well-labeled video, we collected, ground-truthed, and prepared for distribution the Denver intensity of spontaneous facial action database. Twenty-seven young adults were video recorded by a stereo camera while they viewed video clips intended to elicit spontaneous emotion expression. Each video frame was manually coded for presence, absence, and intensity of facial action units according to the facial action unit coding system. Action units are the smallest visibly discriminable changes in facial action; they may occur individually and in combinations to comprise more molar facial expressions. To provide a baseline for use in future research, protocols and benchmarks for automated action unit intensity measurement are reported. Details are given for accessing the database for research in computer vision, machine learning, and affective and behavioral science.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is the de facto standard in the analysis of facial expressions. FACS de-scribes expressions in terms of the configuration and strength of atomic units called Action Units: AUs. FACS defines 44 AUs and each AU intensity is defined on a nonlinear scale of five grades. There has been sig-nificant progress in the literature on the detection of AUs. However, the companion problem of estimating the AU strengths has not been much investigated. In this work we propose a novel AU intensity estimation scheme applied to 2D luminance and/or 3D surface geometry images. Our scheme is based on regression of selected image features. These features are either non-specific, that is, those inherited from the AU detection algorithm, or are specific in that they are selected for the sole purpose of intensity estimation. For thorough-ness, various types of local 3D shape indicators have been considered, such as mean curvature, Gaussian cur-vature, shape index and curvedness, as well as their fusion. The feature selection from the initial plethora of Gabor moments is instrumented via a regression that optimizes the AU intensity predictions. Our AU inten-sity estimator is person-independent and when tested on 25 AUs that appear singly or in various combina-tions, it performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art method which is based on the margins of SVMs designed for AU detection. When evaluated comparatively, one can see that the 2D and 3D modalities have relative merits per upper face and lower face AUs, respectively, and that there is an overall improve-ment if 2D and 3D intensity estimations are used in fusion.},

We show that a deep connection exists between ROC space and PR space, such that a curve dominates in ROC space if and only if it dominates in PR space. A corollary is the notion of an achievable PR curve, which has proper-ties much like the convex hull in ROC space; we show an efficient algorithm for computing this curve. Finally, we also note differences in the two types of curves are significant for algorithm design. For example, in PR space it is incorrect to linearly interpolate between points. Furthermore, algorithms that opti-mize the area under the ROC curve are not guaranteed to optimize the area under the PR curve.},

@book{Bishop2006,
abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering.

abstract = {In 2000, the Cohn-Kanade (CK) database was released for the purpose of promoting research into automatically detecting individual facial expressions. Since then, the CK database has become one of the most widely used test-beds for algorithm development and evaluation. During this pe-riod, three limitations have become apparent: 1) While AU codes are well validated, emotion labels are not, as they refer to what was requested rather than what was actually performed, 2) The lack of a common performance metric against which to evaluate new algorithms, and 3) Standard protocols for common databases have not emerged. As a consequence, the CK database has been used for both AU and emotion detection (even though labels for the latter have not been validated), comparison with benchmark algo-rithms is missing, and use of random subsets of the original database makes meta-analyses difficult. To address these and other concerns, we present the Extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) database. The number of sequences is increased by 22{\%} and the number of subjects by 27{\%}. The target expres-sion for each sequence is fully FACS coded and emotion labels have been revised and validated. In addition to this, non-posed sequences for several types of smiles and their associated metadata have been added. We present baseline results using Active Appearance Models (AAMs) and a lin-ear support vector machine (SVM) classifier using a leave-one-out subject cross-validation for both AU and emotion detection for the posed data. The emotion and AU labels, along with the extended image data and tracked landmarks will be made available July 2010.},

abstract = {We present a novel approach for supervised domain adaptation that is based upon the probabilistic framework of Gaussian processes (GPs). Specifically, we introduce domain-specific GPs as local experts for facial expression classification from face images. The adaptation of the classifier is facilitated in probabilistic fashion by conditioning the target expert on multiple source experts. Furthermore, in contrast to existing adaptation approaches, we also learn a target expert from available target data solely. Then, a single and confident classifier is obtained by combining the predictions from multiple experts based on their confidence. Learning of the model is efficient and requires no retraining/reweighting of the source classifiers. We evaluate the proposed approach on two publicly available datasets for multi-class (MultiPIE) and multi-label (DISFA) facial expression classification. To this end, we perform adaptation of two contextual factors: 'where' (view) and 'who' (subject). We show in our experiments that the proposed approach consistently outperforms both source and target classifiers, while using as few as 30 target examples. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for supervised domain adaptation.},

abstract = {Despite being the appearance-based classifier of choice in recent years, relatively few works have examined how much convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can improve performance on accepted expression recognition benchmarks and, more importantly, examine what it is they actually learn. In this work, not only do we show that CNNs can achieve strong performance, but we also introduce an approach to decipher which portions of the face influence the CNN's predictions. First, we train a zero-bias CNN on facial expression data and achieve, to our knowledge, state-of-the-art performance on two expression recognition benchmarks: the extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) dataset and the Toronto Face Dataset (TFD). We then qualitatively analyze the network by visualizing the spatial patterns that maximally excite different neurons in the convolutional layers and show how they resemble Facial Action Units (FAUs). Finally, we use the FAU labels provided in the CK+ dataset to verify that the FAUs observed in our filter visualizations indeed align with the subject's facial movements.},

@article{Glauner2015,
abstract = {This thesis describes the design and implementation of a smile detector based on deep convolutional neural networks. It starts with a summary of neural networks, the difficulties of training them and new training methods, such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines or autoencoders. It then provides a literature review of convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. In order to select databases for smile recognition, comprehensive statistics of databases popular in the field of facial expression recognition were generated and are summarized in this thesis. It then proposes a model for smile detection, of which the main part is implemented. The experimental results are discussed in this thesis and justified based on a comprehensive model selection performed. All experiments were run on a Tesla K40c GPU benefiting from a speedup of up to factor 10 over the computations on a CPU. A smile detection test accuracy of 99.45{\%} is achieved for the Denver Intensity of Spontaneous Facial Action (DISFA) database, significantly outperforming existing approaches with accuracies ranging from 65.55{\%} to 79.67{\%}. This experiment is re-run under various variations, such as retaining less neutral images or only the low or high intensities, of which the results are extensively compared.},

@article{emonet,
abstract = {The task of the emotion recognition in the wild (EmotiW) Challenge is to assign one of seven emotions to short video clips extracted from Hollywood style movies. The videos depict acted-out emotions under realistic conditions with a large degree of variation in attributes such as pose and illumination, making it worthwhile to explore approaches which consider combinations of features from multiple modalities for label assignment. In this paper we present our approach to learning several specialist models using deep learning techniques, each focusing on one modality. Among these are a convolutional neural network, focusing on capturing visual information in detected faces, a deep belief net focusing on the representation of the audio stream, a K-Means based "bag-of-mouths" model, which extracts visual features around the mouth region and a relational autoencoder, which addresses spatio-temporal aspects of videos. We explore multiple methods for the combination of cues from these modalities into one common classifier. This achieves a considerably greater accuracy than predictions from our strongest single-modality classifier. Our method was the winning submission in the 2013 EmotiW challenge and achieved a test set accuracy of 47.67{\%} on the 2014 dataset.},

@article{stacks,
abstract = {We explore an original strategy for building deep networks, based on stacking layers of denoising autoencoders which are trained locally to denoise corrupted versions of their inputs. The resulting algorithm is a straightforward variation on the stacking of ordinary autoencoders. It is however shown on a benchmark of classification problems to yield significantly lower classification error, thus bridging the performance gap with deep belief networks (DBN), and in several cases surpassing it. Higher level representations learnt in this purely unsupervised fashion also help boost the performance of subsequent SVM classifiers. Qualitative experiments show that, contrary to ordinary autoencoders, denoising autoencoders are able to learn Gabor-like edge detectors from natural image patches and larger stroke detectors from digit images. This work clearly establishes the value of using a denoising criterion as a tractable unsupervised objective to guide the learning of useful higher level representations.},
